Internship
==========

Drupal Project

Link for the site: http://www.vdixit.com/

In this project, the main aim is to create a website where it is easy for the students to apply for the internship & company can post their internship & also the teachers can see whether every student got the internship or not.
So, there are three user: students, companies & teachers. There are anonymous users as well.
The anonymous user can also visit the website & check the content, but to perform any action on the site they must have to register themselves as a user with any of the available user role. There is always link on the page to login or to register the new user, so the anonymous user can easily login or create the new account. 
The company can create their login on the website, by selecting their role as company. Only the company can create the internship & can edit or delete the internship posted by them. No other user with role as company can delete or edit the posted internship. The company can also see the list of the student who are registered on the site & can check the profile of the students & therefore can also send the  message to students whom they are interested in. The company can also see the internship created by  them on the dashboard.
The student can register themselves on the site by selecting their role as a student. After logging in on the site the student can apply for the internship. The student have to create their resume before applying to any of the internship. The student can also send the private message to any of the registered user. While applying for the internship if you want to edit or view your CV then the student can do that. But after applying for the internship then the student can't delete the internship. On the dashboard the student can see the internships they have applied for & their CV.
